    name: "Beholder",

    damage: 3,
    description: "
    One glance at a beholder is enough to assess its foul and otherworldly
    nature. A beholder’s spheroid body is covered in chitinous plates,
    scales, or leathery flesh. Its great bulging eye sits above a wide,
    toothy maw, while the smaller eyestalks that crown its body twist and
    turn to keep its foes in sight. A beholder channels extraordinary levels
    of magical power. Its central eye emits a broad field of energy that can
    nullify the magic of its foes, while its eye stalks blast those foes with
    a host of powerful effects."

    damage: 5,
    description: "
    Despite their great size and musculature, stone giants are lithe
    and graceful. Skilled rock throwers are granted positions of high
    rank in the giants’ ordning, testing and demonstrating their ability
    to hurl and catch enormous boulders. Such giants take the front ranks
    when a tribe has cause to defend its home or attack its enemies."

    name: "One Reborn",
    hp: 23,
    damage: 10,
    description: "
    Born from an unholy Pthumerian ritual which used the bodies of Yharnam's populace,
    The One Reborn is an amalgamate of grotesque misshapen and decayed body parts
    assembled to form one massive unliving creature. It has a singular giant humanoid
    torso attached to the entire mass which controls its entire being, though other
    parts of its body seem just as independently alive as the humanoid on top of the
    horrific creature."

    The Darkbeast is a giant skeletal beast with long strands of blueish black hair
    that emanate electricity throughout its entire body. Its bones and skull appear
    to have engravings on them, perhaps a side effect of the lightning that permeates
    its very being."
